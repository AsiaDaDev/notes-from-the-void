# Notes From The Void
This is a personal project created for the online persona Void the Casual. It is currently a static website designed to house educational articles, resources, and a collection of short stories/books written by the persona, Void the Casual. 

## Making the Project
This project was created with a React single page application by running:
```
npx create-react-app notes-from-the-void
```
The goal of this project was to create a helpful blog to provide a collection of educational writing materials for authors and to act as a showcase for written works by Void the Casual. Once the project was made it was immediately uploaded to the notes-from-the-void repository on Github. Construction of this project was made possible wiht the use of the following:
